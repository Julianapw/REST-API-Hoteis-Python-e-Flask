# REST-API-Hotels-Python-and-Flask

## Description
This repository contains the code developed by me during the **“REST APIs with Python and Flask”** course on Udemy.  
The goal of the course was to learn how to build **RESTful APIs** using Python and the Flask framework, covering essential concepts such as route handling, error management, and authentication.

The API developed in this repository simulates a **hotel management system**, allowing the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of hotels, as well as user authentication.
